Bootstrap reGRID
================

Nesting don't change the column size. "md-6" will have the same size, no matter what.

## How to use

Looking to quickly add this mod to your project? Link to the CSS file on dist folder. By default, reGRID will work up to 12 columns.

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path_to_module/dist/bootstrap-regrid.css" />
```

Or install with the npm package:

```
$ npm install --save-dev bootstrap-regrid
```

After that, import it on your SCSS project file *after* the Bootstrap v4 styles.

```
@import 'path_to_module/regrid/regrid';
```
